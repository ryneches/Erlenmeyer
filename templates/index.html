        <h1>Erlenmeyer</h1>
		    <p> This is Erlenmeyer, a simple blogging platform written in
                Python using Flask, because, let's face it, the world
                needed another blogging platform. Like all blogging
                tools, Erlenmeyer is incomplete, unfinished, and will
                probably wind up being abandoned by the author as soon
                as you get it working.</p>

            <p> Because apathy and abandonment is the fate of all web tools
                (especially blogging tools), Erlenmeyer is designed to
                be the 1963 VW Bug of blogging software. It is not
                intended to be elegant. It is not intended to be fast.
                It is not intended to "scale," whatever that means. It
                is not intended to be extendable. Instead, Erlenmeyer
                is intended to be simple enough for you to modify,
                improve, optimize, extend and hack yourself, even if
                you are not much of a web programmer. Because, like
                the author, you just want to write things and stick
                them on the internet, and you don't want your life to
                include words like, "deploy" and "migrate" in your
                life.</p>

            <p> That said, it isn't really intended to be minimalist
                either. Erlenmeyer is designed to actually work. It is
                a People's Blogging Tool, designed to provide many
                long years of use. The driver should be able to keep 
                it running herself with just a few basic tools and
                a calm, responsible attitude. One shouldn't need to 
                be a genius or a professional to keep a blog running.</p>
