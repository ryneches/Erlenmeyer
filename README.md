Erlenmeyer
==========

## A simple blogging framework written in Python using Flask.


This is Erlenmeyer, a simple blogging platform written in Python using
Flask, because, let's face it, the world needed another blogging
platform. Like all blogging tools, Erlenmeyer is incomplete,
unfinished, and will probably wind up being abandoned by the author as
soon as you get it working.

Because apathy and abandonment is the fate of all web tools
(especially blogging tools), Erlenmeyer is designed to be the 1963 VW
Bug of blogging software. It is not intended to be elegant. It is not
intended to be fast.  It is not intended to "scale," whatever that
means. It is not intended to be extendable. Instead, Erlenmeyer is
intended to be simple enough for you to modify, improve, optimize,
extend and hack yourself, even if you are not much of a web
programmer. Because, like the author, you just want to write things
and stick them on the internet, and you don't want your life to
include words like, "deploy" and "migrate."

That said, it isn't really intended to be minimalist either.
Erlenmeyer is designed to actually work. It is a People's Blogging
Tool, designed to provide many long years of use. The driver should be
able to keep it running herself with just a few basic tools and a
calm, responsible attitude. One shouldn't need to be a genius or a
professional to keep a blog running.
