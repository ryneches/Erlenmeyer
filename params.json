{"name":"Erlenmeyer","tagline":"A research blogging tool written in Python using Flask.","body":"#Erlenmeyer\r\n\r\n### A blogging tool for science and research written in Python using Flask.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Erlenmeyer, a simple blogging platform written in Python using\r\nFlask, because, let's face it, the world needed another blogging\r\nplatform. Like all blogging tools, Erlenmeyer is incomplete,\r\nunfinished, and will probably wind up being abandoned by the author as\r\nsoon as you get it working.\r\n\r\nBecause apathy and abandonment is the fate of all web tools\r\n(especially blogging tools), Erlenmeyer is designed to be the 1963 VW\r\nBug of blogging software. It is not intended to be elegant. It is not\r\nintended to be fast.  It is not intended to \"scale,\" whatever that\r\nmeans. It is not intended to be extendable. Instead, Erlenmeyer is\r\nintended to be simple enough for you to modify, improve, optimize,\r\nextend and hack yourself, even if you are not much of a web\r\nprogrammer. Because, like the author, you just want to write things\r\nand stick them on the internet, and you don't want your life to\r\ninclude words like, \"deploy\" and \"migrate.\"\r\n\r\nThat said, it isn't really intended to be minimalist either.\r\nErlenmeyer is designed to actually work. It is a People's Blogging\r\nTool, designed to provide many long years of use. The driver should be\r\nable to keep it running herself with just a few basic tools and a\r\ncalm, responsible attitude. One shouldn't need to be a genius or a\r\nprofessional to keep a blog running.\r\n\r\n## Credits and dependencies\r\n\r\nErlenmeyer includes these awesome pieces of software :\r\n\r\n* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n* [markdown.js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n* [Bootstrap-Markdown](http://toopay.github.io/bootstrap-markdown/)\r\n* [MathJax](http://mathjax.org)\r\n* [Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/)\r\n\r\nErlenmeyer depends on these awesome pieces of software :\r\n\r\n* [Python](http://python.org)\r\n* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n* [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)\r\n* [sqlite3](http://www.sqlite.org/)\r\n* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)\r\n* [pyandoc](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pyandoc)\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\n![Erlenmeyer Flask](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Duran_erlenmeyer_flask_narrow_neck_50ml.jpg/170px-Duran_erlenmeyer_flask_narrow_neck_50ml.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
